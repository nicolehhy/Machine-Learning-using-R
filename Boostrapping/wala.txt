#Here is a quick example finding the jackknifed sampling distribution
#of the mean of a normal data sample

#first get some random data
n = 100
x = rnorm(n,10,2)
hist(x)


#blank data vector to store results
jack_mean = rep(NA,n)

#for each i from 1 to n, leave the ith observation out
#then calculate the statistic of interest on the remaining observations
for(i in 1:n){
? ? temp_x = x[-i]
? ? jack_mean[i] = mean(temp_x)
}

#histogram of the jackknifed sampling distribution of mu
hist(jack_mean)
